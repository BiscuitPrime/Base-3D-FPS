# Base 3D FPS

A basic Unity 3D project to be used as a template for 3D FPS games.

Contains :
- Organized folders.
- A basic Player character along with its input handling and basic look/movement.
- Basic Interactable architecture for Interactable/Pickable entities.
- Basic test scene.

## Disclaimer :
This was made mainly as a personal project to simplify the repetitive actions of setting up a 3D FPS game. So this project does not really have the vocation to be anything grand.
In any case, feel free to take stuff from it.
